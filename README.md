 This project focuses on leveraging Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance interpretability in research, particularly in machine learning models.
 It aims to provide insights into model predictions, enabling better understanding and trust in AI-driven decisions.

Features
Summarizes research papers effectively.
Provides interpretable outputs for machine learning models.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later.
Flask for building the web application.

Installation
1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
2. Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Flask app
python app.py

Usage
Launch the application by accessing http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
Upload research papers for summarization.
Use the model interpretation module to analyze AI predictions.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for implementation.
Flask: Framework for building the web application.
